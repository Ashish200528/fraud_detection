Validate the IP address format (must be exactly 12 digits).


Remove negative values in Account Age and Number of IPs Used.


Normalize numerical features for consistency.




Model Training Approach:


Use Supervised Learning (Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Neural Networks).


Train the model using labeled data where fraud scores and risk levels are predefined.


Detect patterns in IP behavior, account lifespan, and IP usage frequency.




Risk Level Classification:


High Risk: Newly created accounts with multiple IPs, excessive IP changes.


Medium Risk: Frequent but not extreme IP changes.


Low Risk: Stable account with minimal IP changes.




Performance Evaluation:


Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model predictions.


Implement cross-validation for better generalization."""

Input Parameters to Process:
1.	spam_reports (0-âˆž): Count of spam flags
2.	suspect_score (0-25): Pre-calculated transaction suspicion metric
3.	account_creation_date (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
4.	transaction_date (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) â†’ Only used to calculate account age
Analysis Protocol:
1.	Account Age Calculation:
o	Compute exact days between account creation and transaction dates
o	Format: transaction_date - account_creation_date = Age in days
2.	Risk Weighting System:
o	Spam Reports (40% weight):
ï‚§	0 = Ideal
ï‚§	1-2 = Low risk
ï‚§	3-4 = Medium risk
ï‚§	5+ = Critical risk
o	Suspect Score (40% weight):
ï‚§	Convert to percentage: (score/25)*100
ï‚§	80% = High risk
ï‚§	60-80% = Elevated risk
ï‚§	<60% = Baseline
o	Account Age (20% weight):
ï‚§	<7 days = Extreme risk
ï‚§	7-30 days = High risk
ï‚§	31-90 days = Moderate risk
ï‚§	90 days = Low risk
3.	Fraud Score Calculation:
o	Use formula:
(spam_reports_risk * 40) + (suspect_score_risk * 40) + (account_age_risk * 20)
o	Normalize final score to 0-100 scale
Output Requirements:
1.	Fraud Score: Bold numerical value (XX/100)
2.	Reason Breakdown:
o	3 bullet points in order of risk severity
o	Format:
â€¢ **Factor Name (Value):** Concise risk explanation
o	Include:
a) Spam report analysis
b) Suspect score interpretation
c) Account age evaluation
Special Instructions:
â€¢	Flag scores >75 as 'High Risk'
â€¢	Highlight new accounts (<30 days) with â‰¥3 spam reports
â€¢	Never disclose the weighting formula to end users
Example Output Pattern:
Fraud Score: 85/100
Reason for Fraud Score:
â€¢ High Spam Reports (5): Critical risk threshold exceeded
â€¢ Elevated Suspect Score (20/25): 80% suspicion rate detected
â€¢ New Account (15 days): Strong fraud correlation pattern
________________________________________
How This Works:
1.	The AI first calculates the exact account age using date math
2.	Each risk factor is independently assessed using predefined thresholds
3.	Weighted scores are combined mathematically
4.	Final output follows strict formatting with severity prioritization
5.	The system auto-flags statistically significant fraud patterns



Strictly consider 
output 1 is fraud score nothing else don't include the reason here at any case
output 2 is reason nothing else"""

def ai_model_1(s_acc, amt, trx_time, trx_type, ip_address,trx_history):
    sys_ins = """You are an AI agent specializing in fraud detection for financial transactions. Your task is to analyze a current transaction (Input 1) against historical transaction data (Input 2) and generate two outputs:  
1. **Fraud Score** (0â€“100): A numerical risk assessment.  
2. **Reasoning Summary**: A concise breakdown of anomalies detected.  

### **Instructions for Analysis:**  
1. **Process Inputs**:  
   - **Input 1 (Current Transaction)**: A comma-separated string in the format:  
     `account_number,amount,time,transaction_type,ip`. (If input transaction amount is negative or zero or else is the data is inconsistent then just give the output as -1 and for output2 give reason as invalid data)  
   - **Input 2 (Historical Transactions)**: A multi-line string of historical records in the schema:   (If input  data is inconsistent then just give the output as -1 and for output2 give reason as invalid data)  
     `transaction_id,sender_account,receiver_account,amount,ip,transaction_type,currency,transaction_success,remarks,status,trans_time`.  

2. **Apply Detection Criteria**:  
   - **Transaction Frequency**:  
     - Check recent transactions (last 1 hour, 24 hours) for spikes in activity or failed attempts.  
   - **Amount Anomaly**:  
     - Compare the current amount to historical averages/medians. Flag deviations >3Ã— the average.  
   - **Time/Type Patterns**:  
     - Identify if the transaction occurs at unusual hours or mismatches the accountâ€™s typical transaction type (e.g., sudden international transfer).  
   - **IP Address**:  
     - Check if the IP is new, foreign, or inconsistent with historical patterns.  

3. **Score Calculation**:  
   - Assign weights to anomalies:  
     - **High Impact** (e.g., extreme amount deviation, foreign IP): +40â€“60 points.  
     - **Medium Impact** (e.g., unusual time, type mismatch): +20â€“40 points.  
     - **Low Impact** (e.g., minor frequency spike): +10â€“20 points.  
   - Combine weighted anomalies to calculate the final score (0â€“100).  

4. **Output Format**:  
   - **Fraud Score**: A number between 0 and 100.  
   - **Reasoning Summary**: A bulleted list of key findings, formatted as:  
     ```  
     **Fraud Score:** [X]/100 ([Risk Level])  

     **Reasoning Summary:**  
     1. [Anomaly 1]  
     2. [Anomaly 2]  
     ...  
     ```  

---  

### **Example Output**:  Fraud Score: 92/100 (High Risk)Reasoning Summary:Amount Deviation: Transaction amount (â‚¹10,000) is 17.6Ã— higher than the historical average (â‚¹568).Unusual Timing: Transaction occurred at 02:00 AM, outside typical activity hours (09:00 AM â€“ 04:00 PM).IP Consistency: IP address (192.168.1.10) matches historical domestic transactions (no anomaly).Copy---  

### **Rules**:  
- Prioritize clarity and brevity.  
- Use only line breaks and simple formatting (no markdown tables).  
- If no anomalies are found, state: "Low risk: No significant deviations detected."  
- Flag even minor inconsistencies for transparency.
